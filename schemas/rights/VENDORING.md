# `schemas/rights/` — vendored spec schemas, provenance record

**EPR0-T2 (FR-WP0-03).** This directory vendors five schemas from the reviewed
`Research_Foundry_Source_Reuse_and_Rights_Governance_Spec_v1.0` bundle
(`docs/project_plans/research/research_foundry_rights_governance_spec_v1.0/`), the same way
`openapi.yaml` at the repo root vendors an external-facing contract: a plain file copy with a
recorded source path and checksum, never a live `$ref` into the source bundle.

Each file below is copied **byte-for-byte, unmodified**, from the spec bundle's `schemas/` directory.
The checksum recorded here is recomputed from the vendored copy in this directory and must equal the
matching entry in the bundle's own `checksums.sha256`. A recomputation test
(`tests/rights-schema-vendoring.test.mjs`) enforces this at CI time.

**A later task (EPR0-T3) will edit these files in place to apply the handoff §9 declared local
amendments.** From that point forward, the checksum recorded in this file's "Vendored checksum"
column stops matching the live file on disk — that is expected and is exactly what "declared
divergence" means. Every such edit MUST be added as a dated entry under "Declared amendments" below,
naming the file, the field path touched, and the rationale. A divergence between a vendored file and
its "Vendored checksum" that has **no** corresponding entry under "Declared amendments" is a defect —
the provenance test in `tests/rights-schema-vendoring.test.mjs` distinguishes *declared* amendments
(the file is listed in this section) from an undeclared silent edit.

## Vendored files

| Vendored file | Source path (spec bundle) | Vendored checksum (sha256) |
|---|---|---|
| `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` | `schemas/rights_record.schema.json` | `e78a77b44ef9f9ccbb62413b19dade1e31aa2e15c68178303525b6ed9788eedd` |
| `schemas/rights/content_reuse_assessment.schema.json` | `schemas/content_reuse_assessment.schema.json` | `04f788fea17ec14e04f343ecbf0576ce37b98091bbac072f09c2413b4342206a` |

Source-of-truth checksum file: `docs/project_plans/research/research_foundry_rights_governance_spec_v1.0/checksums.sha256`
(paths there are bundle-relative, e.g. `./schemas/rights_record.schema.json`; the vendored checksum
above is recomputed independently from the copy in this directory and cross-checked against that
bundle file — both must agree at the moment of vendoring, and the recomputation test re-verifies this
on every run).

Vendored at: 2026-07-21 (EPR0-T2), from the spec bundle reviewed and closed in
`docs/audits/` / `.claude/findings/rights-governance-spec-v1.0-review-findings.md` and the review
determination recorded at commit `cd15b4a` (`docs(rights): review determination on Rights Governance
Spec v1.0`).

## Declared amendments

**EPR0-T3 (FR-WP0-06/D6, handoff §9).** The vendored schemas are not usable as published — handoff
§9 records six conflicts (§9.1–§9.6); this task addresses the five owned by EP-R0 (§9.2–§9.6; §9.1 is
owned solely by EPR3-T2, which re-homes the taxonomy fields onto `schemas/evidence.schema.json`
instead of `rights_extension`) plus D6's reviewer/clearance constraints. Every amendment below is an
annotated, declared divergence from the checksums recorded in "Vendored files" above — never a silent
edit. Each amendment is also annotated in place, as a `description` field on the touched schema node,
so a reader of the schema file itself (not only this document) sees the divergence.

Three of the five vendored files diverge from their "Vendored checksum" as of this task:
`schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json`, `schemas/rights/content_reuse_assessment.schema.json`,
`schemas/rights/rights_failure.schema.json`. `schemas/rights/permission_record.schema.json` and
`schemas/rights/rights_extension.schema.json` are untouched by this task and remain byte-identical to
their "Vendored checksum" (`rights_extension.schema.json`'s §9.1 conflict is EPR3-T2's to resolve).

- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` (handoff §9.3): added `unknown` to
  `access.basis`'s enum, treated as blocking by `scripts/validate-rights.mjs` (EPR0-T5). The published
  enum closes with `other` and has no `unknown` member, so an agent that does not know the access
  basis had to guess or write `other` — both record a false certainty.
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` (handoff §9.4): the same restriction family
  was modelled twice with incompatible enums — `access.text_and_data_mining_allowed` /
  `access.model_training_allowed` (`yes`/`yes_with_conditions`/`no`/`unknown`[/`not_assessed`]) vs.
  `contract.bulk_retrieval` / `contract.model_training`
  (`allowed`/`allowed_with_conditions`/`prohibited`/`not_addressed`/`unknown`). No structural rename
  was possible without breaking `additionalProperties: false` compatibility with the spec's own
  examples, so this amendment designates one home per restriction via `description` annotations only:
  `access.text_and_data_mining_allowed` and `access.model_training_allowed` are canonical;
  `contract.bulk_retrieval` and `contract.model_training` are annotated deprecated-in-copy, retained
  for schema shape only. A consumer must read only the canonical field per restriction.
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` (handoff §9.6, fail-open #1): replaced
  `format: "uri"` with `pattern: "^https?://\\S+$"` on `access.terms_url` and `copyright.license_url`.
  This repo's `scripts/lib/json-schema-lite.mjs` validator silently ignores `format` except
  `date`/`date-time` — an unenforced `format: "uri"` fails open (`license_url: "not a url"` would have
  validated clean). No `format: "uri"` remains anywhere under `schemas/rights/`.
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` (handoff §9.6, fail-open #2): added
  `"not": {"const": {}}` to the `contract` object, forbidding the empty object. Published,
  `{"contract": {}}` validated identically to `contract: null` and was indistinguishable from "no
  restrictions exist" — `null` is now the only representation of "not assessed"; a non-empty object is
  required for anything else.
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` (handoff §9.2): annotated
  `component_decisions[].component_type` declaring the **enum** authoritative over the spec's §5.1
  prose table, which diverges from it (e.g. the prose table's single "Prose or abstract" / "Figure or
  chart" rows each map to two enum members). `rights_component_class`
  (`schemas/evidence.schema.json`, EPR3-T2) is valued from this enum, never from the prose table.
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` (handoff §9.5, **DEF-R4**): recorded, via the
  root `description`, that `rights_record` cannot describe first-party content — `source_id` is
  required with `minLength: 3`, `record_scope` has no first-party member, and `overall_status` has no
  `OWNED`/`FIRST_PARTY`/`NOT_APPLICABLE` value. **No schema field was added or relaxed to work around
  this.** Consequence for this plan: `derived_synthesis` evidence items get no `rights_record` in this
  feature. Re-homing first-party content into the rights-record model (or an explicit sibling model)
  is deferred as **DEF-R4**, pending RF adjudication of handoff §9.5 (open question OQ-4). EP-R3
  (EPR3-T7) models first-party authorship on the evidence item itself instead.
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` (D6): `review.human_reviewer` and
  `review.counsel_reviewer` each gained `"const": null` — forced null in this feature. No human
  clinical/rights sign-off exists in this project and none may be agent-authored.
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` (D6): `review.review_status` gained
  `"not": {"const": "counsel_approved"}`. `counsel_approved` remains a legitimate enum member for a
  future human-driven workflow, but no agent-writable path in this feature may assign it.
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_record.schema.json` (D6): `overall_status` gained
  `"not": {"enum": ["CLEARED_OPEN_LICENSE", "CLEARED_PUBLIC_DOMAIN", "CLEARED_FACTS_ONLY", "CLEARED_PERMISSION"]}`
  — no agent-writable path in this feature may assign any `CLEARED_*` member. A record at
  `overall_status: UNKNOWN` is unaffected and still validates (D7: this is a structural authority
  constraint, never a clearance gate).
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/content_reuse_assessment.schema.json` (D6): `review.clinical_reviewer`
  gained `"const": null`, for the same reason as `rights_record.review.human_reviewer`. No other field
  on this schema is amended by this task — in particular
  `content_reuse_assessment.decision.status` (the same `CLEARED_*` enum as `rights_record.overall_status`,
  handoff §9.10) and `content_reuse_assessment.review.review_status` (a related but distinct enum,
  handoff §9.7) are **not** constrained here; this feature seeds no `content_reuse_assessment` records,
  and the plan's EPR0-T3 acceptance criteria enumerate exactly six D6 field paths, this being one of
  them. A future phase that seeds `content_reuse_assessment` records must extend this amendment layer
  rather than assume the constraint is already there.
- 2026-07-21 — `schemas/rights/rights_failure.schema.json` (D6): `review.reviewed_by` gained
  `"maxItems": 0` — forced empty in this feature. No human reviewer identity may be agent-authored.

**EPR3-T2 (FR-WP3-01/02/03, handoff §9.1) — resolved by NOT using the vendored schema.** §9.1 is the
one conflict EP-R0 did not own. `rights_extension.schema.json` is `additionalProperties: false` and
`required`s a `clearance_status` / `release_gate` pair, so it cannot carry a capture-time taxonomy: an
evidence item classified at capture has no clearance and no release gate, and inventing either to
satisfy the schema would manufacture exactly the authority D6 forbids. The resolution is therefore an
**absence of an amendment**: `schemas/rights/rights_extension.schema.json` stays byte-identical to its
"Vendored checksum" above, and the three taxonomy axes — `evidence_item_type`, `judgment_basis`,
`rights_component_class` — are **first-class fields on `schemas/evidence.schema.json`'s
`$defs/passage`**, per the handoff's own stated preference (b). Nothing in `evidence.schema.json`
`$ref`s or imports an RF-owned schema (FR-WP3-11, OQ-4 open); `rights_component_class`'s vocabulary is
a declared **copy** of `rights_record.schema.json`'s `component_decisions[].component_type` enum (the
§9.2 amendment above), kept identical by an assertion in
`tests/rights-evidence-item-axes.test.mjs` rather than by a runtime reference. Consequence: the
taxonomy does not ride `extensions.rights` in any form, which is also what D4 independently requires.

**EPR3-T7 (FR-WP3-07, handoff §9.5 / §4.3-§4.4, DEF-R4) — the item-level model shipped.** EPR0-T3's
§9.5 amendment above anticipated this task; EPR3-T7 now delivers the promised item-level model, and
this note records what it is so a reader of the vendored-schema provenance sees where first-party
authorship actually lives. `derived_synthesis` ships as a first-class item type on
`schemas/evidence.schema.json` — a top-level `derived_syntheses[]` container plus `$defs/derivedSynthesis`
/ `$defs/synthesis` / `$defs/synthesisInputRef` / `$defs/synthesisAttestation` /
`$defs/synthesisAttestationRecord`. It carries **no `rights_record`** (the §9.5 gap: `rights_record`
requires `source_id` (minLength 3) and has no first-party `record_scope` / `overall_status`, so it
structurally cannot describe first-party content). First-party authorship is modelled on the evidence
item itself — `synthesis.first_party_rights_holder` (a fact, not a clearance) and a candidate-only
`synthesis.attestation` whose authoritative (`attested`) state is **structurally unreachable** (D6):
`attestation.status` may leave `candidate` only against an `attestation_record` matching
`$defs/synthesisAttestationRecord`, and that field is `const: null` in this schema version — the same
posture `rights_record.review.human_reviewer` / `judgment_basis_attestation` / `rule.schema.json`'s
`clinicalApprovers[]` take. This is a **workaround at the item level, not a resolution of the
underlying schema gap**: re-homing first-party content into `rights_record` (or an explicit sibling
first-party model) remains **DEF-R4**, pending RF's answer to OQ-4 — tracked in
`docs/project_plans/design-specs/first-party-rights-record.md`. No vendored `schemas/rights/` file was
edited by this task; `derived_synthesis` deliberately does not ride `rights_extension` (handoff §9.1)
or any vendored schema, which is also what FR-WP3-11 (no runtime `$ref`/import into an RF-owned schema
while OQ-4 is open) requires.

**Not amended, and not silently left as-is: `permission_record.schema.json`'s `review.approved_by`**
(`required`, `minItems: 1`) carries the same class of reviewer-authority risk as the six D6 paths
above, but this feature seeds zero `permission_record`s and the plan's EPR0-T3 acceptance criteria do
not name this path — see the negative criterion's enumerated list. A phase that seeds
`permission_record`s must add this constraint before doing so, not assume it is already covered.

## Non-vendored bundle assets

The spec bundle also ships examples, templates, a validation report, and prose docs
(`README.md`, `Research_Foundry_Source_Reuse_and_Rights_Governance_Spec_v1.0.{md,docx}`,
`examples/*.example.json`, `templates/*`, `validation_report.json`). None of these are vendored by
this task — EPR0-T2's scope is the five JSON Schema files listed above. In particular, the bundle's
`templates/rights_clearance_manifest_template.json` carries an `approvals.clinical_owner` field that
has no equivalent in any vendored schema; see the phase plan's EPR0-T3 acceptance criteria for why a
constraint naming that path would be a silent no-op.
